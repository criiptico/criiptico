### Hi there, criiptico here! 👋

I just finished ✨[poketype](https://github.com/criiptico/poketype)✨ and am open to working on another project.

- ⏳ In Progress Personal Projects (Note: Each project is in its research stage 📑)
  + Animal Database | Using REST API to develop a local database to track an animal and to display a map of where an animal is.
  + YouTube Unsubscriber | A mass and filtered way to unsubscribe to YouTube channels you're subscribed to.
  + Track Me | Tracking a pair of tracking devices

- ✅ Completed Personal Projects
  + ✨[poketype](https://github.com/criiptico/poketype)✨. Poketype is a web-application that takes two pokemon and gives you the most effective move in terms of move type and damage dealt to each pokemon.

### Hi there, criiptico here! ðŸ‘‹

I just finished âœ¨[poketype](https://github.com/criiptico/poketype)âœ¨ and am open to working on another project.

- Some projects I'd love to work on in the future are here:
  + A-Star Visualization with C++ with a map of the University of Illinois at Chicago campus. Although, there's still some research I need to do for this.
  + Next project . . . secret . . . ðŸ¤­

- âœ… Completed Personal Projects:
  + âœ¨[poketype](https://github.com/criiptico/poketype)âœ¨. Poketype is a web-application that takes two pokemon and gives you the most effective move in terms of move type and damage dealt to each pokemon.

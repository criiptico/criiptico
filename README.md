### Hi there, criiptico here! ðŸ‘‹
- I'm currently working on [poketype](https://github.com/criiptico/poketype). In this project I'm learning how to use Python, communicate with an API,
parse a json file with Pydantic, make a python package, POST and GET methods through Flask, use React, and essentially design the back end and front end of a website.

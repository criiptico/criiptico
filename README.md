### Hi there, criiptico here! 👋

- 👷🏻 I'm currently working on ✨[poketype](https://github.com/criiptico/poketype)✨. Poketype is a web-application that takes two pokemon and gives you the most effective move in terms of move type and damage dealt to each pokemon.
  + In this project I'm learning how to use Python, communicate with an API,
parse a json file with Pydantic, make a python package, use POST and GET methods through Flask, use Flask, and essentially design the back end and front end of a website. 

- Some projects I'd love to work on in the future are here:
  + A-Star Visualization with C++ with a map of the University of Illinois at Chicago campus. Although, there's still some research I need to do for this.
  + Next project . . . secret . . . 🤭
